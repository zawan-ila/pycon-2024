# PyCon Pakistan 2024

Recording: To be added soon

Here are slides for an introduction to MetaClasses I gave at PyCon Pakistan 2024. The talk goes all the way from the basics of metaclasses to showing their usage in real-world libraries like Django. Unfortunately, there is very little text in the slides. I will add a link to the recording once it is available.
